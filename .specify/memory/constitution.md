# Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development
Every book chapter, section, and code example MUST start with a clear specification; specifications are non-negotiable and drive all content creation.

### II. Docusaurus-First
All book content MUST be authored in Docusaurus markdown format; adherence to Docusaurus conventions (e.g., folder structure, front matter) is mandatory for seamless deployment.

### III. Code-First Examples
Code examples, where applicable, MUST be runnable, independently testable, and directly integrated into the Docusaurus build process; examples without verifiable code are not permitted.

### IV. AI-Assisted Authoring
Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus are the primary tools for content generation, refinement, and validation; human authorship focuses on high-level guidance and critical review.

### V. Iterative Deployment
The book MUST be continuously deployed to GitHub Pages; each significant content update or feature addition requires a deployment for immediate review and accessibility.

### VI. Traceability
Every decision, content change, and code modification MUST be traceable back to its originating specification, task, or prompt history record (PHR).

## Technology Stack

The core technology stack consists of Docusaurus for static site generation, Markdown for content authoring, and GitHub Pages for deployment. All development MUST adhere to the standards and best practices of these technologies.

## Content Workflow

Content creation follows a strict spec-driven process: define (spec), plan (plan), implement (tasks), review, and deploy. All content MUST undergo automated validation checks before deployment.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other project practices. Amendments require a formal review and approval process, documented via an Architectural Decision Record (ADR). All content and code MUST comply with the principles outlined herein.
