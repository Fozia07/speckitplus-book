# Module Spec: Vision-Language-Action Systems (VLA)

**Module**: 04
**Topic**: Vision-Language-Action Systems
**Status**: Draft

## Objective
Enable robots to understand voice, vision, and language and convert them into actions.

## Learning Outcomes
- Use Whisper for voice commands.
- Connect LLMs with ROS 2.
- Convert language tasks into robot actions.
- Multi-modal perception understanding.

## Chapter Outline
1. **What is VLA**
2. **Voice Input using Whisper**
3. **Vision Perception Basics**
4. **LLM Task Planning**
5. **Language-to-ROS2 Action Mapping**
6. **Multi-Modal Architecture**
7. **Safety and Failsafe Systems**

## Success Criteria
- Voice commands trigger robot actions.
- LLM plans multi-step tasks.

## Constraints
- Focus on integration, not model training.

## Out of Scope
- Training custom large models.
