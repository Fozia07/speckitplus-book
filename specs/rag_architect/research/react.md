# Research: React Frontend

## Purpose in this context
React will be used to create the chatbot component that integrates into the Docusaurus website, providing an interactive interface for users to ask questions and receive AI-generated responses with source citations.

## Integration approach
- Create a floating chat widget component that can be embedded in Docusaurus
- Implement text selection detection and contextual query functionality
- Use React hooks for state management and API communication
- Ensure responsive design that works across devices

## Key considerations
- Docusaurus theme compatibility and styling
- Performance optimization to avoid impacting page load times
- State management for chat history within browser session
- Accessibility and keyboard navigation support
